# qtetris
A tetris game. Also includes a self-learning AI, based on a Evolving Neural Network.

Requires pygame for graphics to function.

Note: If you do not have Python 3.5 and 64-bit Windows, replace the .pyd files with the respective files of name ...py.py from their folders. That is gamecls-=-.pyd -> gameclspy.py, with its name changed to gamecls.py, for example.
